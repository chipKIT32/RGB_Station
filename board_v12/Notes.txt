RGB Station : v1.0 : 11/9/2017First build on 11/20/2017:Incorrect Footprints sizes:* CPU* Reset controller (update footprint to SOT-23, as SC70 doesn't seem to be very available and we have the space)* SwitchesIncorrect Footprint wiring:* Switches (these switches connect pins 1 and 3 when pressedIncorrect Silk Screen:* PRG and RESET labels are swappedParts missing from BOM:* Red power LED is far too bright - use larger resistor to dim it (4.7K is still not large enough)* Green LED is far too bright* Blue LED is far too bright* The buttons listed in the BOM do not feel too small to press. Force required is nice.Second build on 12/14/2017 - of v1.1 board* Everything worked correctly except error in schematic with switches - wrong pins connected together, so they are always shorting to ground
